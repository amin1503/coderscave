            <h2>Introduction to Responsive Web Design</h2>
            <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that aims to create web pages that provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.</p>
            <p class="full-content" style="display:none;">With the increasing use of smartphones and tablets to access the internet, it has become essential for websites to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
            <ul class="full-content" style="display:none;">
                <li><strong>Fluid Grids:</strong> Instead of fixed-width layouts, responsive websites use fluid grids that adjust proportionally to the size of the screen. This allows content to flow and resize smoothly across different devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Images:</strong> Images in responsive designs are also made flexible, ensuring that they scale proportionally and maintain their aspect ratio across different screen sizes. This prevents images from becoming distorted or overflowing their containers on smaller screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> CSS media queries are used to apply different styles based on various factors such as screen width, device orientation, and pixel density. By using media queries, designers can create layouts that adapt to different devices and viewport sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile-first Approach:</strong> With the increasing popularity of mobile devices, many designers and developers adopt a mobile-first approach to responsive web design. This involves designing the mobile version of a website first and then progressively enhancing it for larger screens.</li>

            <h2>The Importance of Accessibility in Web Development</h2>
            <p>In today's digital age, the internet serves as a vital gateway to information and services for people around the world.</p>
            <p class="full-content" style="display:none;">However, not all users have the same abilities or access to technology, making it essential for websites to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their disabilities or limitations. This is where web accessibility comes into play.</p>
            <ul class="full-content" style="display:none;">
                <li><strong>Inclusive Experience:</strong> Web accessibility ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can access and benefit from the information and services provided on the internet. It promotes inclusivity and equal opportunity for participation in the digital world.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Many countries have laws and regulations in place that require websites to be accessible to people with disabilities. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in legal consequences, including fines and lawsuits.</li>
                <li><strong>Expanded Audience Reach:</strong> By making your website accessible, you open it up to a larger audience. This includes not only people with disabilities but also elderly users, users with temporary impairments (such as a broken arm), and users in situations where they cannot use a mouse or keyboard (such as when using a mobile device).</li>
                <li><strong>Improved SEO:</strong> Accessibility features, such as descriptive alt text for images and semantic HTML markup, can improve search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines like Google prioritize accessible websites because they provide a better user experience for all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Usability for Everyone:</strong> Many accessibility features, such as clear navigation, descriptive headings, and intuitive user interfaces, benefit all users, not just those with disabilities. By focusing on accessibility, you can create a better user experience for everyone who visits your website.</li>
